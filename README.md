# Virtual-Pet
A game that allows you to have a virtual pet that you interact with, whether you are giving it water and food, or just new toys, the pet gives responses to whatever input is given. Read me will also be updated with new goals, such as programing addtional pets, and different tasks that the animal can do, if time permits. This will be updated in tandem with the road map. Project has been completed, finishing touches were put on it. I would like to pick up this project again, after I am done with this class and keep on expanding it. May add water functions, or more pets next time.

# Virtual-Pet

The virtual pet project is a project that seeks to program a code that will allow the user to interact with a virtual pet. So far only a cat or dog, and simple task like feed and water the pet. Other tasks like playing with the pet, will hopefully be fullfilled by the end of the project. By the end of the project hopefully adding more pets to the will be the goal. Other goals of the project will be outlined in the roadmap and updated here.

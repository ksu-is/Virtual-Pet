Project Road Map:

The code of codebase I had gotten the idea from seems to slightly faulty, the food types and water is not difened. I expect this is becuase they were put into lists, which was strange. Unfortanly I have already deleted the other part of the codebase that was faulty, the things that it wanted me to import did not exist. However the rest of the code was working as attended, but I would like to look at it, and change many things. Scraping big parts of it is not out of the question.
